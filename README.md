## Setup

The following instructions setups a new virtual environment for python and installs the needed libraries.  
These instructions assumes that the user is using a Windows machine.

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

To install CUDA-supported PyTorch: [reference](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

(12.1 in this example)

```cmd
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

Pip install the ultralytics package including all [requirements](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/pyproject.toml) in a [**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment with [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

### Hyperparameter
Change hyperparameter `fliplr` in `default.yaml` file at path `.venv/Lib/site-packages/ultralytics/cfg/default.
yaml` to `0.0` to switch off flipping, this is to ensure that the direction of the arrows are not learnt wrongly.
